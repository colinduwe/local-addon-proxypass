# Local Add-on Proxy Images â€¢ [![PRs Welcome](https://img.shields.io/badge/PRs-welcome-brightgreen.svg)](https://github.com/colinduwe/local-addon-proxypass/pulls/)

This plugin allows nginx to serve images missing from your local site from your production server. 

For example, if your local site is serving a page with a reference to an image:  
https://www.example.local/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/cat.jpg. 
and that file is not in your local site's file system it will try to serve the image from the production server (www.example.com). 
https://www.example.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/cat.jpg
